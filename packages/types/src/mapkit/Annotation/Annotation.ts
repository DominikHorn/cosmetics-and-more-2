/**
 * MapKit JS allows single-point annotations to be shown on a map. This is done
 * by creating an mapkit.Annotation object and adding it to a map. The framework
 * provides two built-in objects for your convenience, mapkit.MarkerAnnotation,
 * mapkit.ImageAnnotation. mapkit.MarkerAnnotation is the easiest to use,
 * so it will be described first.
 *
 * It's important to highlight a difference between the way annotations work in
 * MapKit JS and native MapKit. In native MapKit, there are annotation objects
 * and annotation views. You can decide the annotation view that should be used
 * for a particular annotation by implementing mapView:viewForAnnotation in the
 * map's delegate. In MapKit JS, there is only the annotation, which is both model
 * and view. Annotations can still be initialized by supplying any object that has
 * coordinate, title and subtitle properties. The look of annotations can also be
 * customized. The difference is that we opted for a more direct approach of having
 * the developer create annotation views explicitly rather than through a delegate.
 *
 * A callout is a standard or custom element that can give more information about an
 * annotation. A standard callout displays the annotationâ€™s title and subtitle, if one
 * is provided. A callout appears when an annotation is selected either programmatically
 * or interactively (by clicking or tapping). A callout goes away when the annotation is
 * deselected programmatically or interactively, either by tapping or clicking on the
 * map, or selecting another item on the map
 *
 * ### Overview
 * An annotation represents data that you want to display on the map's surface. Each
 * annotation is associated with a coordinate on the map. It is rare that you'll need to
 * create a mapkit.Annotation object; use the more common extended objects,
 * mapkit.MarkerAnnotation and mapkit.ImageAnnotation, instead.
 *
 * Use mapkit.Annotation when you need to customize a view in a way that can't be
 * accomplished with mapkit.ImageAnnotation.
 *
 * ### Create a Custom Annotation
 * In this example, we create a custom annotation to show a person on the map
 * using their initials. The initials are enclosed in a gray circle, which we
 * style using the following CSS:
 *
 * ```css
 * .circle-annotation {
 *   width: 32px;
 *   height: 32px;
 *   border-radius: 50%;
 *   color: #FFF;
 *   background-color: #CCC;
 *   text-align: center;
 *   line-height: 32px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The following code creates the annotation:
 *
 * ```
 * var people = [
 *   { title: "John Appleseed",
 *     coordinate: new mapkit.Coordinate(37.3349, -122.0090201),
 *     role: "developer",
 *     building: "HQ" },
 *   { title: "Anne Johnson",
 *     coordinate: new mapkit.Coordinate(37.722319, -122.434979),
 *     role: "manager",
 *     building: "HQ" }
 * ];
 *
 * var factory = function(coordinate, options) {
 *   var div = document.createElement("div"),
 *       name = options.title,           // "John Appleseed"
 *       parts = name.split(' ');        // ["John", "Appleseed"]
 *   div.textContent = parts[0].charAt(0) + parts[1].charAt(0);    // "JA"
 *   div.className = "circle-annotation";
 *   return div;
 * };
 *
 * people.forEach(function(person) {
 *   var options = {
 *       title: person.title,
 *       data: { role: person.role, building: person.building }
 *   };
 *   var annotation = new mapkit.Annotation(person.coordinate, factory, options);
 *   map.addAnnotation(annotation);
 * });
 * ```

  /**
   * Creates a new annotation given its location and initialization options.
   *
   * ### Parameters
   * - coordinate: The coordinate at which this annotation should appear.
   * - factory: A factory function that returns a DOM element used
   *   to represent this annotation.
   * - options: A hash of properties with which to initialize the annotation.
   *
   * ### Return Value
   * A mapkit.Annotation instance
   *
   * ### Discussion
   * The factory function returns a DOM element used to represent this annotation.
   * It can be a single element or a parent element with children. This function
   * is called with the following two arguments:
   * - coordinate (mapkit.Coordinate). The annotation's coordinate.
   * - options (AnnotationConstructorOptions). Options passed to the annotation
   *   constructor that can be used to add context to the custom annotation.
   *
   * The options include title and subtitle, which are displayed in a callout if they are present.
